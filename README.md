# seven-segment-device

The book Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley offers the following problem:

Seven-segment devices provide an inexpensive display of the ten decimal digits: 
Write a program that displays a 16-bit positive integer in five seven-segment digits. 
The output is an array of five bytes; bit i of byte j is one if and only if the i th segment of digit j should be on.

This project implements a solution—and more—using Unity 3D.
